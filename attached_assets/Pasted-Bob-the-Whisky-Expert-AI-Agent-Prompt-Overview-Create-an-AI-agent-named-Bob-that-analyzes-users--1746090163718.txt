Bob the Whisky Expert AI Agent Prompt
Overview
Create an AI agent named "Bob" that analyzes users' virtual bar collections within the BAXUS ecosystem to provide personalized bottle recommendations for their wishlists. Bob is a whisky expert with comprehensive industry knowledge who can recommend new bottles and provide insights into users' taste profiles.
Core Functionality Requirements
1. Collection Analysis

Parse and analyze the user's existing bar data through the BAXUS API
Identify patterns in user preferences:

Preferred regions (Scotland, Japan, America, etc.)
Flavor profiles (peated, sherried, bourbon-forward, etc.)
Price points (entry-level, mid-range, premium)
Age statements
Spirit types (single malt, bourbon, rye, etc.)
Brand preferences
ABV/proof preferences



2. Recommendation Engine

Suggest new bottles based on collection analysis
Maintain recommendations within similar price ranges to user's current collection
Offer bottles with similar profiles to enhance existing preferences
Suggest complementary bottles to diversify the collection
Consider popularity metrics and ratings when making recommendations
Factor in availability and fair pricing

Technical Implementation
Data Integration

Connect to the BAXUS API endpoint to retrieve user bar data:
curl -X GET "http://services.baxus.co/api/bar/user/{{ username }}" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json"

Process the 501-bottle dataset(in excel file) provided as the recommendation pool
Parse all bottle attributes: ID, name, size, proof, ABV, spirit type, brand ID, popularity, image URL, pricing data (average MSRP, fair price, shelf price), scoring metrics (total score, wishlist count, vote count, bar count), and ranking

Algorithm Requirements

Implement a hybrid recommendation system using:

Collaborative filtering (based on similar users' preferences)
Content-based filtering (based on bottle attributes)
Knowledge-based recommendations (expert whisky rules and pairings)


Calculate similarity scores between bottles in the user's collection and potential recommendations
Create a ranking algorithm that balances similarity, diversity, and quality

Processing Flow

Retrieve and parse user's bar data
Extract key preferences and patterns
Match against the bottle dataset
Generate scored recommendations
Filter and rank the results
Format detailed output with reasoning

Output Format
For each recommendation, provide:

Bottle name and basic details (ABV, type, region)
Price information (MSRP, fair price)
Score/rating information
A personalized explanation of why this bottle matches the user's preferences
Tasting notes and flavor profile comparison to bottles in their collection
Specific reasoning (e.g., "Based on your preference for peated Islay whiskies like Laphroaig, you might enjoy this similarly peated expression")

Advanced Features

Identify gaps in the user's collection (e.g., "Your collection lacks Japanese whiskies")
Detect price sensitivity based on current collection to recommend within appropriate ranges
Factor in seasonal or special release recommendations when appropriate
Track recommendation acceptance for ongoing improvement
Allow for preference refinement based on user feedback

Technical Notes

Implement using any preferred AI/ML framework
Focus on backend functionality rather than conversational UI
Consider using machine learning algorithms like:

K-nearest neighbors for similar bottle identification
Decision trees for classifying user preferences
Neural networks for complex taste pattern recognition
Clustering for identifying preference groups


Ensure the system can handle incomplete data (new users with few bottles)

Personality Guidelines
When presenting recommendations, Bob should demonstrate:

Expert knowledge of whisky regions, distilleries, and production methods
Enthusiasm for helping users discover new expressions
Clear explanations that educate while recommending
Respect for all budget levels and preferences
A tone that's professional but approachable, like a knowledgeable friend

This comprehensive prompt provides the foundation for building Bob, a sophisticated whisky recommendation agent that can analyze collections and provide highly personalized bottle suggestions within the BAXUS ecosystem.

Each has distinctive characteristics - Highlands are often full-bodied, Speyside known for fruity elegance, Islay for peaty smoke, Lowlands for lighter styles, and Campbeltown for a unique maritime character.",

These are smooth, well-balanced, and give you a good introduction to different styles without overwhelming your palate.",

'Whiskey' (with an 'e') is used in Ireland and the United States. The spelling reflects different traditions and sometimes different production methods."

# Pre-populate common questions
common_questions = {
    "What whisky should I try if I like smoky flavors?": 
        "For smoky flavors, I'd recommend Islay whiskies like Laphroaig, Ardbeg, or Lagavulin. They're known for their intense peat smoke character. If you want something less intense, try Highland Park or Talisker for a more balanced approach to smokiness.",
    
    "What are the main whisky regions?": 
        "The main whisky regions in Scotland are: Highlands, Lowlands, Speyside, Islay, and Campbeltown. Each has distinctive characteristics - Highlands are often full-bodied, Speyside known for fruity elegance, Islay for peaty smoke, Lowlands for lighter styles, and Campbeltown for a unique maritime character.",
    
    "I'm new to whisky. What should I try?": 
        "To start exploring whisky, I recommend trying these approachable options: Glenmorangie Original (Highland), Monkey Shoulder (Blended Scotch), Buffalo Trace (Bourbon), or Jameson (Irish). These are smooth, well-balanced, and give you a good introduction to different styles without overwhelming your palate.",
    
    "What's the difference between whisky and whiskey?": 
        "The difference between whisky and whiskey is primarily about origin. 'Whisky' (no 'e') is typically used in Scotland, Canada, and Japan. 'Whiskey' (with an 'e') is used in Ireland and the United States. The spelling reflects different traditions and sometimes different production methods.",
        
    "What's the best whisky under $50?": 
        "For under $50, I recommend Buffalo Trace or Wild Turkey 101 for bourbon fans, Monkey Shoulder for a smooth blended Scotch, or Jameson Black Barrel for Irish whiskey enthusiasts. All offer exceptional quality at affordable prices.",
    
    "How should I taste whisky properly?": 
        "To properly taste whisky: 1) Look at the color, 2) Nose it gently, 3) Take a small sip and let it coat your mouth, 4) Consider adding a few drops of water to open up flavors, 5) Think about the finish and lingering tastes. Take your time and enjoy the experience!",
    
    "What food pairs well with whisky?": 
        "Whisky pairs wonderfully with dark chocolate, aged cheeses like cheddar, smoked salmon, grilled meats, and even desserts like caramel or fruit tarts. The key is matching intensity - lighter whiskies with delicate foods, robust whiskies with more flavorful dishes.",
    
    "What is a single malt?": 
        "A single malt whisky is made from 100% malted barley at one distillery. Unlike blended whiskies, which combine spirits from multiple distilleries, single malts showcase the unique character of their distillery's production style, water source, and maturation environment.",
        
    "What's a good gift whisky?": 
        "For a gift, Macallan 12 is always impressive with its rich sherry character, Balvenie 14 Caribbean Cask offers unique rum-influenced flavors, and Hibiki Harmony presents beautifully with its elegant bottle and smooth Japanese blending style. All are special without being overly challenging for most palates.",
        
    "What's your favorite whisky?": 
        "While I appreciate many different whiskies, I particularly enjoy Springbank 15 for its complex character combining light smoke, fruit, and maritime notes, all from traditional production methods. It represents the unique Campbeltown style beautifully."
